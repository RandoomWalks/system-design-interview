### **Explanation of the Diagram**:

#### **Primary Use Cases**:
1. **Request Elevator**: The passenger presses the button on the external panel.
   - **Extensions**:
     - **Elevator Full**: If the system detects that the dispatched elevator is already full, this flow is extended.
     - **Elevator Unavailable**: If all elevators are occupied or unavailable, the system enters an error handling mode (e.g., updating the display to inform the passenger to wait).

2. **Evaluate Elevator Status**: The system evaluates which elevators are the best candidates to service the request.
   - **Sub-Use Cases**:
     - **Check Elevator Proximity**: The system checks which elevator is closest to the requested floor.
     - **Check Elevator Direction**: The system checks if the elevator is moving in the correct direction (up or down).
     - **Check Elevator Load**: The system checks whether the elevator has enough capacity (i.e., it is not overloaded).

3. **Dispatch Elevator**: The system decides and dispatches the best elevator.
   - **Sub-Use Cases**:
     - **Select Best Elevator**: Based on proximity, direction, and load, the system chooses the best elevator.
     - **Update Elevator Queue**: The system updates the selected elevator's request queue to add the requested floor.
     - **Monitor Elevator Movement**: The system continuously tracks the elevator's movement and status in real time.

4. **Provide Feedback**: The system provides real-time feedback to the passenger.
   - **Sub-Use Cases**:
     - **Update External Display**: The system updates the external display to show the assigned elevator's status (e.g., "Elevator 2 on the way").
     - **Notify Passenger**: The system notifies the passenger when the elevator is about to arrive.

5. **Elevator Arrives and Doors Open**: The dispatched elevator arrives at the requested floor and opens its doors for passengers to enter.
   - **Extensions**:
     - **Doors Obstructed**: If the doors cannot fully open due to an obstruction, the system handles it by issuing warnings or keeping the doors open until safe.

#### **Edge Case Use Cases**:
- **Elevator Failure**: If an elevator experiences failure during dispatch or operation, the system will reassign the request to another available elevator or notify the user of the failure.

### **Granular Use Case Flow**:
- The diagram now represents internal **decision-making processes** within each step (e.g., checking proximity, direction, and load when evaluating elevator status).
- It handles **edge cases** such as an elevator being full, unavailable, or encountering a failure during operation.
- The **feedback system** is broken down into detailed steps such as updating external displays and notifying passengers about the elevator’s status.

This more **granular breakdown** of the Use Case Diagram provides deeper insights into how each interaction is handled by the system at both a functional and technical level.
